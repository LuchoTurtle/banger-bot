The bot is still under development but it is mainly intended for you and your friends to share music on a group chat and automatically upload it to a Google Drive folder you set up. \n
Detect songs from Youtube and upload them. You can also Shazam it!
Enjoy your music with your friends! ðŸŽ‰

For the bot to properly work, you need a _Google Drive project set up and authorize this bot on startup to edit it_. 
From there on, the bot will listen to relevant URLs and take care of downloading and uploading your music to Google Drive. \n
