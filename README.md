## Getting started :hatching_chick:

### 1 - Change the bot token on the `docker-compose.yml` file
```
environment:
  - BOT_TOKEN=<paste your token here>
```

### 2 - Install `docker` and build

Run the following commands to boot up the Docker with the proper dependencies installed.
```
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose up
```

### 3 - You're ready to go! :tada:

You're sorted! Give the bot a go and interact with it on Telegram to see how he responds! You can find the bot on Telegram with the nickname `@banger_music_bot`. Make sure to say `/start` at the beginning!
